This project is very similar to the first project from front-end mentor challenges.

It is completely done and the design looks very similar to given challenge.

NOTE:
    - only unfinished feature is the change of collor on #NFT-img:hover event 
        ^ I wasnt able to solve this 
        ^ maybe with different code design ca it be done
        ^ but with my design it was not possible
        ^ the main reason is problem that OPACITY parameter is INHERITED 
        ^ and thus it also changes the opacity of given img background
