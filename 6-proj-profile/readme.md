Project number 6 was very challenging. A lot of knowledge was questioned.

In the end everything is done correctly. Maybe the background is little different than design but whatever. I wasnt able to achieve itfor 100%.

It is still fun but I am slowly starting to hate designing these card components. 

See you next time.
